### ABSTRACT ###
This study presents a comprehensive commodity price prediction framework
utilizing exchange-specific XGBoost models with log-normal transformation
and stationarity conversion. Technical indicators (CCI) were
incorporated to enhance predictive accuracy across four major exchanges:
US, LME, FX, and JPX.

### 1. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ###
  - No statistical analysis results available.

### 2. METHODOLOGY ###
  - Data Transformation: Log-normal → First-order differencing
  - Technical Indicator: CCI
  - Model: XGBoost with rolling window (size=7)
  - Feature Selection: Optimal lags via ACF analysis (max=30)
  - Outlier Treatment: Imputation (no data removal)

### 3. RESULTS ###
  - No model results available.

### 4. CONCLUSIONS ###
  - Unable to draw conclusions as no models were trained successfully.
